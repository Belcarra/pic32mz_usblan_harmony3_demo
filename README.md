# Belcarra PIC32MZ USBLAN Harmony 3 Demostration Project

This is a demonstration kit for the **Belcarra PIC32MZ USBLAN Driver** using either of **Microchip's* 
**PIC32MZ EF Starter Kit** or **PIC32MZ EF Curiosity Board**.

The kit demonstrates how **Networking over USB** can be used as an alternative to **Ethernet** or
**WiFi** to provide lower cost networking to a Microchip PIC32MZ based board with performance that is close to Ethernet at over 80Mbps per second.

**Networking over USB** allows a point to point network connection to be used between
the PIC32MZ board and a Windows, Mac or Linux host.

This kit is based on the [**Microchip Harmony 3 Framework demonstration project**](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony):

    - apps/tcpip/web_net_server_nvm_mpfs

The kit was developed using [**MPLAB X IDE v5.20**](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide/0). 

There are two projects available in the kit:

    - pic32mz_ef_sk.X - support for the PIC32MZ_EF_SK Ethernet Starter Kit
    - pic32mz_ef_curiosity.X - support of the PIC32MZ_EF_CURIOSITY Board

The sample application was been modified to add the following Harmony 3 components:

    - net Telnet
    - net Iperf
    - net Zeroconf
    - USB High Speed Driver
    - USB Device Driver
    - Belcarra USBLAN Function Driver

The **Belcarra PIC32MZ USBLAN Driver** is a TCPIP NIC driver that uses the PIC32MZ USB High Speed Device Driver
to connect to another system. It uses CDC-EEM to transfer network packets to and from the other system. The driver is distributed in this project as a libary archive (libusblan.a)

## Testing

To test with this project you need:

    - have MPLAB X IDE installed
    - have either the PIC32MZ EF SK or PIC32MZ EF Curiosity Board

The project has all of the files needed to compile and build the test application. It is not necessary to have the Harmony 3 Framework installed. 

## Belcarra Windows USBLAN 
This demonstration can be used with or without the **Belcarra USBLAN Driver.** A demonstration kit containing Windows drivers that support this demonstration project is available here:

   - [belcarra_usblan_iot_demo_drivers](https://github.com/Belcarra/belcarra_usblan_iot_demo_drivers.git)
 
## Supported Microchip Evaluation Boards

    - PIC32MZ EF Ethernet Starter Kit (pic32mz_ef_sk)
    - PIC32MZ EF Curiosity Board Bundle (pic32mz_ef_curiosity)

## CDC-EEM

**Networking over USB** uses a USB connection to transfer TCP IP Frames (aka packets) between the USB Device (in this case a Microchip Evaluation Board) and a
USB Host (typically a Windows, Mac or Linux system.)

There are various protocols defined by USB.org:

    - CDC-ECM
    - CDC-EEM
    - CDC-NCM

The **Belcarra PIC32MZ USBLAN Driver** implements **CDC-EEM**. The **CDC-EEM** protocol allows for simple point to point transfer of frames between the USB
Host and the USB Device. It supports frame aggregation and his very little overhead.

The **USBLAN** driver supports zero-copy received frames. I.e. the data is received into a receive buffer by the USB High Speed driver and that buffer is given
to the TCPIP layer for processing.

The **USBLAN** driver also supports zero-copy transmit frames or can aggregate multiple frames depending on how the data is formatted by the TCPIP lyaer.


## Performance

Using iperf the pic32mz_ef_sk board can source TCP data at about **70-80 Mbits/second with Ethernet** and about **60-70 Mbits/second using USBLAN**.

## Belcarra PIC32MZ USBLAN Driver

The kit is set up to use the **Belcarra PIC32MZ USBLAN Driver**. That driver is available under license from Belcarra Technologies. Simply copy the USBLAN
driver into **src/config/*/driver/usblan**.

To use this kit without the Belcarra driver remove the **USBLAN** definition from the X32-gcc Preprocessing macros and compile.

## Microchip Eval Boards 

### PIC32MZ_EF_SK - Ethernet Starter Kit PIC32MZ2048EFM144 - [DM320007-C](https://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/microchip-technology/DM320007-C/DM320007-C-ND/5401235)

Configurations:

    - pic32mz_ef_sk_usblan - USBLAN and Ethernet
    - pic32mz_ef_sk - Ethernet only 

There are two versions of this kit, you may to need to chnage the processor selection to match your kit:

    - DM30007 - non-crypto PIC32MZ2048EFH144
    - DM30007-C - crypto PIC32MZ2048EFM1444

### PIC32MZ_EF_CURIOSITY - Curiosity Board PIC32MZ2048EFM100 - [DM320104-BNDL](https://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/microchip-technology/DM320104-BNDL/DM320104-BNDL-ND/9094799a)

**N.B. the USB UART is shown plugged into Mikro Bus #1. The project configuration requires it to be in Mikro Bus #2.**

Configurations:

    - pic32mz_ef_sk_curiosity_usblan - USBLAN and Ethernet
    - pic32mz_ef_sk_curiosity - Ethernet only

## Testing Setup

Use two systems:
    1. Linux development and testing for Ethernet
    2. Windows for testing USBLAN

Linux setup:
    - Chrome with two tabs open, for the two possible IP addresses that may be used for the Ethernet (depending if the Ethernet is the first or second interface). E.g.: http://192.168.40.145/ - Ethernet only configurations http://192.168.40.146/ - USBLAN and Ethernet configurations
    - Terminal window open running minicom pointing at appropriate serial port, configured to 460800 baud. Port names may vary, but on my system: /dev/ttyACM0 - PIC32MZ EF SK USB2UART port /dev/tty/USB0 - PIC32MZ EF Curiosity USBUART click board port

Windows setup:
    - Chrome with one tab open, set to the USBLAN IP address. E.g: http://192.168.188.2/
    - Terminal window (e.g. Cygwin mintty). Various tests, but typically: ping 192.168.188.2

The Chrome tabs should display the following screen, with the Random Number being updated rapidly:

![Web Server Screen](/img/demo-webserver.png "web server")

For the non _usblan_ configurations you will only see the webpage on the Ethernet IP address. 

IP address:

    - Ethernet is assigned by DHCP from your local DHCP server, see it's DHCP Lease table
    - USBLAN will be at 192.168.188.2


On the Starter Kits only buttons 1 and 2 work. Button 3 functionality is lost because the MPU pin it is on is used for the USB2UART Tx line.

On the Curiosity board, there is only one button. 



## PIC32MZ EF Curiosity 

The current (mid 2019) Harmony 3 framework does not have any PIC32MZ EF Curiosity board application samples. 
It does have the support so that the Harmony Configurator 3 can support the board. 

This was done by duplicating the pic32mz_ef_sk project to get a pic32mz_ef_curiosity project. After changing
the processor from PIC32MZ2048EFM144 to PIC32MZ2048EFM100 the MHC Pin configuration table was used
to setup of the correct pin configuration.

The following pins were added to the pin configuration:

PIC32MZ EF Curiosity Tx/RX Pins

| Pin | Signal |
| --- | ---------|
| 2 | BSP_STBY_RST |
| 7 | U2TX |
| 8 | U2RX |
| 11 | ERXCV |
| 16 | ERXCLK |
| 20 | RGB_LED_RED | 
| 24 | RGB_LED_GREEN |
| 25 | RGB_LED_BLUE |
| 35 | ERXERR |
| 39 | INT1 |
| 40 | INT2 |
| 41 | ERXD0 |
| 42 | ERXD1 |
| 48 | U1TX |
| 49 | CLKI |
| 64 | BSP_WIFI_INT |
| 69 | U1RX |
| 70 | EMDC |
| 71 | EMDIO |
| 76 | ETXEN |
| 85 | ETXD1 |
| 86 | ETXD0 |
| 96 | SWITCH1 |
| 99 | LED1 |
| 100 | LED2 |
